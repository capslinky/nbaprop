SECTION 4: CONTEXT FACTORS
================================================================================

is_back_to_back     TRUE if playing second game in 2 days (rest disadvantage)
days_rest           Days since last game (1 = back-to-back, 2+ = rested)

recent_mins_avg     Average minutes in last 5 games
season_mins_avg     Average minutes for full season
minutes_factor      Recent mins / Season mins:
                    - > 1.0 = playing MORE minutes recently
                    - < 1.0 = playing FEWER minutes recently

opp_defense_factor  Opponent's defensive factor for this stat type:
                    - > 1.0 = opponent ALLOWS more than average (good matchup)
                    - < 1.0 = opponent ALLOWS less than average (bad matchup)
                    - 1.05 = opponent allows 5% more than league average

opp_defense_rank    Opponent's rank in allowing this stat (1-30):
                    - 1-5 = Worst defense (allows most) = SMASH SPOT
                    - 6-10 = Below average defense = Good matchup
                    - 11-20 = Average defense
                    - 21-25 = Above average defense
                    - 26-30 = Best defense (allows least) = TOUGH matchup

                    - > 1.0 = faster than average = more possessions
                    - < 1.0 = slower than average = fewer possessions

vegas_game_total    Vegas over/under for total game points (e.g., 225.5)
                    - High (235+) = expected shootout = boost scoring props
                    - Low (215-) = expected defensive game = reduce scoring props

blowout_risk        Risk of blowout based on spread:
                    - HIGH = spread > 10 points (starters may rest)
                    - MEDIUM = spread 7-10 points
                    - LOW = spread < 7 points (competitive game)

================================================================================
SECTION 5: MODEL OUTPUT
================================================================================

model_projection    Final projected value after all adjustments
base_projection     Initial projection before context adjustments
edge_pct            Edge percentage: (projection - line) / line × 100
                    - Positive = projection ABOVE line (lean OVER)
                    - Negative = projection BELOW line (lean UNDER)
                    - Higher absolute value = stronger edge

confidence_pct      Model confidence (0-100%):
                    - Based on consistency, sample size, trend strength
                    - Higher = more reliable projection

recommended_pick    Model recommendation:
                    - OVER = bet the over
                    - UNDER = bet the under  
                    - PASS = edge too small or confidence too low

context_flags       Visual indicators for key factors:
                    - 💥 SMASH SPOT = great defensive matchup (rank 1-5)
                    - 🛡️ TOUGH DEF = bad defensive matchup (rank 26-30)
                    - ⚠️ B2B = back-to-back game (-8% adjustment)
                    - 🏃 FAST PACE = high combined pace (boost)
                    - 🐢 SLOW PACE = low combined pace (penalty)
                    - 📈 HIGH TOTAL = game total 235+ (scoring boost)
                    - 📉 LOW TOTAL = game total <215 (scoring penalty)
                    - 💨 BLOWOUT RISK = large spread (may reduce minutes)
                    - ⏰ MINS UP = recent minutes trending up
                    - ⏰ MINS DOWN = recent minutes trending down

================================================================================
SECTION 6: ADJUSTMENT BREAKDOWN (in percentage points)
================================================================================

These show how much each factor adjusted the base projection:

adj_defense_pct     Adjustment from opponent defense (+/- %)
adj_location_pct    Adjustment from home/away (+2.5% home, -2.5% away)
adj_b2b_pct         Adjustment from back-to-back (-8% if B2B)
adj_pace_pct        Adjustment from combined pace factor
adj_game_total_pct  Adjustment from Vegas game total
adj_blowout_pct     Adjustment from blowout risk
adj_minutes_pct     Adjustment from minutes trend

Example: If adj_defense_pct = 5.0, the projection was boosted 5% due to 
         a favorable defensive matchup.

================================================================================
HOW TO USE THIS REPORT
================================================================================

1. FILTER by recommended_pick = "OVER" or "UNDER" to see actionable plays

2. SORT by edge_pct (absolute value) to find highest-edge opportunities

3. LOOK FOR plays with:
   - High edge_pct (|edge| > 10%)
   - High confidence_pct (> 60%)
   - High over_rate_pct for OVER picks (> 60%)
   - Low over_rate_pct for UNDER picks (< 40%)
   - Favorable context_flags (💥 SMASH SPOT, 🏃 FAST PACE, etc.)

4. AVOID plays with:
   - ⚠️ B2B flag (higher variance)
   - 💨 BLOWOUT RISK (minutes uncertainty)
   - Low games_analyzed (< 10 games = small sample)
   - High std_dev (inconsistent player)
